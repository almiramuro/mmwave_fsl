# Millimeter Wave Radar Sensing Technology for Filipino Sign Language Recognition

## Paper Abstract

Filipino Sign Language (FSL) is a complete, natural, and visual language primarily used by the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (DHH) community in the Philippines. With FSL's lack of documentation and support from the government, there has been a huge communication gap between the DHH and society. Considerable amount of research has been made to develop sign language recognition systems based on computer vision or wearable technology, however, most computer vision systems are limited to controlled settings while wearable systems raise issues such as inconvenience to user. Millimeter-wave (mmWave) technology has recently seen potential in gesture recognition applications and allows the system to be non-contact and resistant to environmental factors while ensuring high resolution for recognition of small movements. An mmWave-based FSL recognition system that can translate isolated signs into their equivalent gloss was developed. The Texas Instruments IWR1443 radar sensor was used to collect data fed into a preprocessing algorithm and a deep learning model composed of multiview 2D CNNs and LSTM. 4 models were trained based on a dataset of 24 FSL signs gathered with 3 native Deaf signers in 3 environments with varying levels of noise. A total of 3240 samples were collected which resulted in a trained model that attained a peak overall accuracy of 94.9\% and an average realtime recognition latency of about 2.01 seconds. The model's performance was found to be comparable to both existing FSL and mmWave recognition systems, laying down the foundation for future work on FSL recognition using mmWave.
